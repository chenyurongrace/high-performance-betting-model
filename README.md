# High-Performance Betting Model

## Overview

This project implements a **Monte Carlo-based sports betting model** with **Bayesian updating** for dynamic probability adjustments.

## Features

- **Monte Carlo simulations** for match predictions
- **Bayesian inference** to adjust team strength dynamically
- **Poisson goal modeling** for realistic football scores
- **Performance optimizations** (Multithreading, SIMD)
- **Comparison with real betting markets**

## Installation

To run the Python version:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py

Roadmap
✅ Step 1: Monte Carlo Simulation
✅ Step 2: Bayesian Updating
✅ Step 3: Performance Optimization (C++/Rust)
✅ Step 4: Real Match Data Integration
